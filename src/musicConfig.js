    desc: `This odd combination has been one I've been interested in writing for quite a while. 
      The humorous pairing of a comically high instrument with one comically low makes for quite an entertaining piece regardless of content. 
      Using each instrument to their strengths and then pairing them proved to be a fun challenge!`,

    title: "I Dream of Mists",
    desc: `Written at the Brevard Music Center (and read by their orchestra) in Brevard, North Carolina, "I Dream of Mists" is a 6 and a half minute piece dedicated to my time there. 
      The concept of the piece is that of laying on your back and staring at the clouds in the sky- some are hazy mists while others are thunderheads. 
      The orchestra emulates this feeling with hazy string textures, emphatic brass, and numerous woodwind solos.`,

    title: "The Ostrich",
    desc: `Written for a mixed combo often referred to as Pierrot (Flute, Bb Clarinet, Violin, Cello, and Piano),
     'The Ostrich' is a vivid depiction of nature and its interaction with human civilization. 
      I felt frustrated that the forests I grew up in had disappeared and been replaced by tightly compact townhomes.
      This piece draws upon natural sounds I grew up with, as well as chaos that comes as humans impact these environments.
      The title comes from a metaphor associated with the ostrich, which is hiding one's head in the sand to avoid predators.`,

    title: "Crack in the Hourglass",
    desc: `This piece was written in Fall of 2021 and was premiered at the Springville Museum of Art (UT). 
      The string quartet was inspired by a piece of sculpture there, entitled "Drip Field One" by Stephanie Leitch. 
      The piece begins and ends in the same manner- with an ethereal, otherworldly violin solo.
      The pulsating rhythms featured in all of the string instruments act as the eternal flow of time.
      The melodic figures and elements of the piece break against this flow in a desperate attempt to break free- and never do. `,
