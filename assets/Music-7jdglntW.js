Inspired by the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah,
      I drew upon two different moods in this piece. One is that of joy and brightness! I imagine someone seemingly dancing upon the
      sky, floating above the clouds. And yet, there is nothing but clouds and sky for miles. The combination of joy and isolation makes
      for a light yet melancholic solo that slowly winds itself down.

      The text, written by Alanna Hess, uses a garden as a metaphor for one's ability to communicate artistic ideas. The piece is dark,
      conveying despair as the narrator laments their inability to share their ideas with the world. Throughout 3 songs (split between interludes),
      the narrator slowly reaches a state of humility and confidence.

      The concept of the piece is that of laying on your back and staring at the clouds in the sky- some are hazy mists while others are thunderheads. 
      The orchestra emulates this feeling with hazy string textures, emphatic brass, and numerous woodwind solos.`,sideText:["July 2023","Full Orchestra","6'"],inviteLink:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZ_ufYDZLGo",searchTerms:[]},{title:"Swarm",desc:`Written for the Brevard Music Center and premiered by the BMC New Music Ensemble.

      a more homogenous sound, representing swarms of insects as a single entity. Fast, exciting,
